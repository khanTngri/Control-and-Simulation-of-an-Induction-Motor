## 📘 Overview

This project focuses on the **analysis, modeling, and control** of a three-phase **induction motor** using MATLAB and Simulink.  
Three control methods are implemented and compared:

1. **Direct-On-Line (DOL) connection**  
   The motor is connected directly to the three-phase grid. Torque and current waveforms are analyzed under load.

2. **Scalar Control (V/f Control)**  
   The voltage and frequency are varied proportionally to maintain a constant ratio (U/f).  
   The response of speed and current is compared with the direct-on-line case.

3. **Vector Control (Field-Oriented Control, FOC)**  
   The most advanced method, allowing independent control of torque-producing and flux-producing currents.  
   Includes implementation of Park transformation, PI regulators, and slip speed calculation.

## ⚙️ Features

- Full simulation models for each control method in **Simulink**  
- Automatic visualization of results (currents, speed, torque, magnetic flux)  
- Clear parameter calculation section  
- Well-commented MATLAB code translated fully into English  
- Educational-friendly structure (for learning, teaching, and demonstration)

## 🧠 Theoretical Background

The induction motor model is based on standard equations of the asynchronous machine in the **dq (rotating)** reference frame.  
The vector control approach follows the **Rotor Flux-Oriented Control (RFOC)** scheme with decoupled torque and flux control loops.

## 📊 Simulation Results

Each simulation automatically produces plots:
- Speed response and reference comparison  
- Phase currents (a, b, c)  
- Electromagnetic torque  
- Flux and slip angular velocity  
- Components of stator current (*i₁x*, *i₁y*)

All results are shown in MATLAB figures and can be exported as PDF or images for reports.
