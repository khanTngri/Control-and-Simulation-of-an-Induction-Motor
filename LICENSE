Project: Control and Simulation of an Induction Motor (Motor No.5 – 4AP80-2)

Description:
This project focuses on the analysis, modeling, and control 
of an induction motor using MATLAB and Simulink.
It includes simulation models for direct-on-line startup, 
scalar (V/f) control, and vector control (RFOC/IFOC), 
along with parameter calculation scripts and visualization tools.
